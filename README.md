This is a small game of drag and drop. There are four puzzles in this game. Each puzzle consists of four pieces. This is a very fun little game, but this game has two bugs. The first one is that the puzzles can be placed at random. You don't need to make sure they are only one picture in that place . I set the variables and only finish. Will become true.One block only can put one pieces. Then the second bug is that the system won't refresh the game area itself after completing a small game. I added a reset code to refresh the game area when I click on any of the images below.
